# Project 01 – Active Directory Deployment (Windows Server)

This project lays the **foundation** for my full-scale Security Operations Center (SOC) lab by configuring a Windows Server 2019 machine as an **Active Directory Domain Controller** using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). This becomes the authentication backbone for all future systems and simulations.
