Project 01 – Active Directory Deployment (Windows Server)

This project lays the foundation for my entire SOC lab environment by configuring a Windows Server as a Domain Controller (DC). I installed and promoted the server using **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** and built a domain called `lab.local`.

Key Tasks Completed:
- Installed Windows Server 2019 in VirtualBox
- Assigned a static IP address
- Promoted server to domain controller
- Created a domain: `lab.local`
- Created a test Organizational Unit (OU)
- Created a sample user for login testing

Why It Matters

Active Directory is the **core of enterprise identity management**. It helps:
- Authenticate users
- Enforce group policy
- Organize and control access

This project sets the stage for future logging, SIEM integration, endpoint protection, and response playbooks in my SOC build.

What I Learned

- How to stand up a Windows Server environment from scratch  
- What AD DS does and how it fits into network security  
- Why domains and OUs are central to enterprise IT

This is the first of many foundational layers in my hands-on SOC development journey.
