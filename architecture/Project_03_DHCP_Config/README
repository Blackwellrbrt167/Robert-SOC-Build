# Project 03 ‚Äì DHCP Configuration in Windows Server

This project demonstrates how to configure the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** service on a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller. DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and related network configuration to client devices in the domain.

## üîß Summary

We installed and configured the DHCP Server role, created a DHCP scope, and successfully allowed a domain-joined client machine to receive its network settings via dynamic assignment.

   - Defined an IP address range for the internal lab network.
   - Configured subnet mask, lease duration, and default gateway.

4. **Activated the Scope**
   - Verified that the new scope was active and ready to lease addresses.

5. **Tested DHCP on Client VM**
   - Ensured the client VM was set to **Obtain IP address automatically**.
